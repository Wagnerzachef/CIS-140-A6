## Assignment: Bash Week five (5)
## Author: Zachary Wagner
## Version: 10.27.2023.03
## Purpose: BASH: You have been asked to write a script that takes in a csv file containing employee data. Put each item into a separate array so that they can be processed. Pass the age array to a counting method that outputs the number of employees that are old enough to receive social security benefits.

IFS=","

declare inFile="$1"
declare outFile="SocialSecurityBenefits.txt"
declare -a lastNames
declare -a firstNames
declare -a ages

main() {
    readFile
    ssCount "${ages[@]}"
    exit 0
}

readFile() {
    declare -i lineNumber=0

    while read lastName firstName age
    do
        lastNames[$lineNumber]=$lastName
        firstNames[$lineNumber]=$firstName
        ages[$lineNumber]=$age
        (( lineNumber++ ))
    done < $inFile
}


ssCount(){
declare -a ages=("$@")
declare -i count=0
declare -i ssAge=62

for (( i=0; i < ${#ages[@]}; i++ ))
    do
           
        if [[ "${ages[i]}" > "($ssAge - 1)" ]]
                 
            then
                    count=$count+1
                echo "${lastNames[i]}, ${firstNames[i]}" >> $outFile
        fi
    done
echo "Total employees eligable for social security: $count" >> $outFile
}
